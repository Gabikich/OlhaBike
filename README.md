Limitations and Future Work

Limitations


The website is currently built using only HTML and CSS, limiting its functionality and interactivity.
The site supports basic features like booking services buttons and subscribing to news forms, but there are no advanced features for users to interact with.
The user interface could be further improved for better accessibility, ensuring it is more inclusive for users with disabilities.


Future Work

Enhanced Interactivity: Integrate JavaScript to create a more dynamic, interactive user experience, such as real-time booking updates and notifications.
Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode option for users to switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences.
Online Shop: Develop an e-commerce section where customers can browse and purchase bikes, accessories, and services directly from the website.
Improved Accessibility: Focus on improving accessibility by adding features like keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and better color contrast for visually impaired users.
